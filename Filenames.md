# Main issues
> 
> - [ ] **Information and length**: informative filenames to minimize reliance on additional 'key' metadata file, while avoiding too long names 
> - [ ] **Lab-specific restrictions**:  e.g., filenames in Synchrotron in France cannot be modified after recording, while in Japan they could 
> - [ ] **Unifying**: Data from the same specimen maybe acquired in two locations, but assigned numeric label may not correspond. JP10 is not FR10 necessarily

# Formatting principles
- No white spaces
- Only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
- Do not rely on letter case 
- Use separators (hyphen or underscore) in a systematic and meaningful way.
  
# Name fields 
On this section:

- *Modelity agnostic*: field should be common to all subprojects and types of data
- *Modality specific*: fields exclusive to the specific type of recording and/or lab
- *[REQUIRED | OPTIONAL]*: if an field described as OPTIONAL is missing the user should be able to infer the 'default' information

Revise: Key1-val1_key2-val2 Specify key abbreviations and value types (string, numeric)

### Modality agnostic  
#### Identifiers [REQUIRED]
 - `<specID>` (*numeric*) specimen  | `<ID>` e.g., if calibrating 'cal01' 
 - `<loc>`  (*string*) location, country
 - `<lab>` (*string*) laboratory 
 - `<recID>`(*string | numeric*) not-user defined, timestamp or alphanumeric id provided by the equiment when recording 
#### Suffix [OPTIONAL]
- ``<...>`` e.g. xxx_v02 indicates the recording was redone. 

> Issues
>  Identifiers Do we need <loc> & <lab> or <loc> | <lab> ? 
>  <recID> specifications depending on lab/ equipment
> - [ ] Filenames from equipment calibration or tests like: implant02_dremel, test01, etc. They would ideally also include loc, lab, recID 
> - [ ] Suffix assumptions need to be specified here, e.g., is the last version always the valid one? 
 
### Modality specific
Here we need a summary of the main imaging *modalities* and the different *data types* they generate 

#### SRÂµCT
#### Speciment status [REQUIRED]
- ``<status>`` Vivo | dead | Dying 
#### Acquisition parameters[REQUIRED] 
Here is where things can scalate into long strings...
- ``<...>``
 > issues: 
 > - [ ]  disambiguate terms like: field, modality and type 
 > - [ ] here some fields will be exclusive of some labs..
