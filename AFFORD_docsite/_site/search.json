For example, a digital object identifyer (DOI). E.g., Code in Zenodo will receive a DOI. - no: no persistent identifier\n\n[!NOTE] To facilitate academic citations, a Github public repository can be archived in Zenodo see integration Github-Zenodo. Zenodo can only access public repositories. If the repository belongs to an organization, the organization owner may need to approve access for the Zenodo application. The repository should contain a license so readers know how they can reuse your work.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\npublic | restricted - public: anyone with the link can access (see permissions) - restricted: there is a log in, an admin must give accss to the user\n\n\nSecurity\nhigh | low - high: access management and data are secured, protected from bots and unwanted downloaded or deletions - low: there are no special measures taken to ensure data or privacy security\n\n\nPermissions\nwrite | read - _write_ can edit files (and delete, no restricted write is considered) - _read_ can view (and download) but cannot edit\n\n\nVersion control\nyes | no - yes: users can roll back to previous versions (e.g., previous uploads or ‘git push’). Users can track changes from the different versions - no: users cannot see what was before in that folder or file\n\n\nBackup\nyes | no - yes: users can restore previous versions of a folder which are regularly backed up into an external server - no: no restore previous versions available."
