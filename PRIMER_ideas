# CRS PRIMER ideas 

## 1. A very basic setup of Github to make your code more FAIR 

Why is this a CRS Primer? version control, accessibility, findability 

The Git-related terminology can be confusing and much of the advanced functionality which developers need can overwhelm researchers. Online documentation becomes too detailed and technical and pushes some users away. They run a research lab, not a team of developers. However, the dependence of their research output on code will necessarily increase, if they are to aim at producing reproducible data.  This is a concise very practical manual describing a user scenario in which no advanced coding skills are needed and only the basic Git functionalities are used. Simply, keeping your local code synchronized with your online repository and being able access previous versions of your code. Additional content for users with advanced interest describes how this could work in a lab where several projects are run.  A box clarifies terms like Git, Gitlab and Github, push, commit, pull, etc.  

There is already some work on this, presenting different cases with a lengthy intro on open data (https://doi.org/10.1007/s40614-019-00202-5) . The idea here is to do something more concise and practical (primer style), with better visuals. Less technical an easy to read than IT provided tutorials.  

 

## 2. Making a website with R and Github 

Why is this a CRS Primer? facilitates sharing, dissemination, education 

Intended for regular users of R and python (not necessarily expert programmers) and basic users of Github. Making a static website, hosted free, without external dependences and minimal amount of coding (R markdown | Quarto). This can be helpful to researchers in multiple scenarios: as a main lab website (documentation, vacancies, projects, education), to promote an event or as a personal website. Researchers can disseminate text, figures and tables (even with basic interactive widgets are possible), code and links, without the need for IT support or paid subscriptions. A simple workflow is described and links for more complicated possibilities provided.   

 

[There is a bunch of good tools in python as well but will make this too long]  

 

## 3. Using R interactive data tables as a data finder or an image explorer  

Why is this a CRS Primer? facilitates data sharing, findability, accessibility  

Integrates well with Primer #2 (website in Github)
