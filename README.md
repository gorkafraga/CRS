 ## File naming
 Some example of file names:  
 From SOLEIL synchrotron: 020_Mouse89883_5823_PBS_27keV_9000proj_ring_z0_x0, 
 From Japan synchrotron: JP21-invivo-1scan-phase3-postinjection-brain-40min

### Known issues
- [ ] Information and scale: informative filenames to minimize reliance on additional 'key' metadata file, while avoiding too long names 
- [ ] Lab-specific restrictions:  e.g., filenames in Synchrotron in France cannot be modified after recording, while in Japan they could 
- [ ] Unifying: Data from the same specimen maybe acquired in two locations, but assigned numeric label may not correspond. JP10 is not FR10 necessarily
  

### General principles
BIDS has a standardized way of naming files that tries to implement the following principles:
- No white spaces
- Only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
- Do not rely on letter case (UPPERCASE and lowercase)
- Use separators (hyphen or underscore) in a systematic and meaningful way.

## Name parts 
### Modality agnostic  
#### Identifiers [REQUIRED]
 - `<specID>` specimen | `<ID>` e.g., if calibrating
 - `<loc>` country
 - `<lab>` institution 
 - `<recID>` (not-user defined) timestamp or alphanumeric id provided by the equiment when recording 

> Known issues
> - [ ] Filenames from equipment calibration or tests like: implant02_dremel, test01, etc. They would ideally also include loc, lab, recID 

#### Suffix [OPTIONAL]
- ``<...>`` e.g. xxx_v02 indicates the recording was redone. 

> Known issues
> - [ ] Suffix assumptions need to be specified here, e.g., is the last version always the valid one? 
 
#### Modality specific
 
##### SRÂµCT
Specimen description
- ``<status>`` Vivo | dead | Dying 

Acquisition parameters 

- ``<...>``
 
##### MRI

Specimen description

- <status> Vivo | dead | Dying 

Acquisition parameters 

- <...>

##### Microscope
