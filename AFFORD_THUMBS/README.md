## TO DO 
- Separate Quarto for the part where metadata is generated. Save metadata table as xls 
- Ensure path of pics will be found to send as 'package'


## Issues

- Naming: specID includes country, relabel it to `<country><specID>` ?
- Hover resizing will have to be adapted if Scroller is TRUE
- Using tabs remove the TOC
- Button visibility when having one for "FILTER ROWS'
