With the FAIR principles in mind, we consider the ORD needs of the reference project and potential solutions

# Open research data
_Data_  | _Metadata_ | _Docs_ | _Code_
- `Data`: research output that will be analyzed
- `Metadata`: numeric and text descriptors associated to the data. Essential for analysis 
- `Docs`: text and figures essential to understand the data and metadata. E.g., File naming convention
- `Code`: scripts for data preprocessing, analysis and output inspection 

## Data 

### Data types and formats
 ... insert table ...  

### File types
_raw_  | _reconstructed_ |  _exported_ 
- `raw`: source data, directly obtained from the measurement instrument
- `reconstructed`: when raw data requires some minimum preprocessing (reconstruction) to be usable
- `exported`: format has been changed for shareability 

# Metadata
Essential metadata will be stored at different levels
- `Filenames`: filename parts and metadata stored depend on data format and type
- `Folder structure`: measurements from different labs (e.g Japan, France) are stored in separate folders
- `Table`: a key table will explain and extend description of files in the main folders. These tables can be
- `Text logs`: when applicable, text or markdown files (e.g., README.md)  at each folder level will inform of content, report errors, etc

2. Sharing lighter data
3. Managing and storing code with version control
4. Managing and storing documentation with version control
5. Hosting a central project html  with links and utilities like the interactive tables
