# Proposal

The project AFFORD aims at designing a sustainable open research data (ORD) support framework. It uses the reference project [Fluid Dynamics of the central nervous system](https://interfacegroup.ch/project/fluid-dynamics-of-the-central-nervous-system/).Partners are the InterfaceGroup of the University of Zurich and Center for reproducible science (CRS).

This doc is summarizing goals and parts of the project with involvement of the CRS.

The main work packages are:

WP1. \[InterfaceGroup\] Coordination work

WP2. \[CRS\] Establish structures

WP3. \[InterfaceGroup\] Determine Resource requirements

WP4. \[CRS\] Define open research data (ORD) support model

# CRS Work packages

## WP2. Establish structures

*Deliverables* in AFFORD proposal

### Improved monitoring protocol (item 2.1.3 \| public )
The main goals:  
-   Estimate resources for open science strategy

-   Check *first cycle* of data compliance to FAIR principles

-   Improve protocol for *second cycle*

> CRS \>\> Create a central HUB

### Refine metadata documentation (item 2.2.5 \| public)
Main goals:  

-   Assess available ORD guidelines (general and field specific) and customize them

-   Consider the types of output in the ref project

-   Determine repositories

> CRS \>\> Documentation of the central HUB (FNC, folder struct) - Decide on repositories and hosting sites

## WP4 Define ORD support model
