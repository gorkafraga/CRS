## Suggestions
- User friendliness : render table with only a few rows, and perhaps cols (default filter?)
  
## Extensions
 - A tick box to mark some of the rows (eg., upon inspection)
- KEYTABLE extension in datat table to navigate as in excel 
- Try 'bscols' with filters/check boxes and put them in a sidebar

## Queries to Willy 
- minimum pic size. Lossy compression acceptable? 

## Issues
- Formatting of file naming description (see MNE toolbox documentation )
- ~! display errors when showing FILTER PANE buttons (the browser cuts it )
- Naming: specID includes country, relabel it to `<country><specID>` ?
- Hover resizing will have to be adapted if Scroller is TRUE
- Using tabs remove the TOC ?
- Button visibility when having one for "FILTER ROWS'
